They sent the Original Voluminuous.  When I advised Amazon the product was not what was described, they no-hassle replaced it but unfortunately it was again the Original.  I like the Volumunious products, best pharmacy mascara,  but I wanted Carbon black not the original product as it is thicker and darker.",,0,B000R1RKVY

En lo personal no me gustan las máscaras a prueba de agua, por lo cual si tu buscas un producto que sea resistente al agua, esta no ees a una buena opción para ti. A pesar de no ser un producto waterproof aguanta muy bien la humedad en climas cálidos como la playa. Es fácil de retirar, en lo personal no me gusta rizar las pestañas, prefiero un acabado natural que este producto me da, sin embargo si a ti te gustan las pestañas muy levantadas o no las tienes rizadas de forma natural, es un hecho que te bajara las pestañas. Le doy 5 estrellas porque cumple con lo que yo busco en una máscara de pestañas.",,1,B000R1RKVY
