B0014ZWHZQ,"LOVE All Loreal Revitalift products! This works great for me, as I have issues with my upper eyelid drooping sometimes, and have bags undereye sometimes after sleepy nights. Also with swelling issues it works great. During hayfever season I tend to swell in my eyes/face and this helps tremendously!! HIGHLY recommend. All my friends ask what I use for my skin care, even strangers when I reveal my age.","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2019","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/1855654a-afcc-4e5a-8d79-3af5e7ce768c._CR0,0,352,352_SX48_.jpg",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUS2ONRJPQZGTNEATPP6MIGRLKQ,Hope Lyon,0,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Erases bags and eyelid droop,Verified Purchase,"35 people found this helpful

B0014ZWHZQ,I received this product with the top partially fastened onto the bottle. The eye cream won't pump out. I requested a replacement but was declined as this is an item that can't be returned or replaced.

B0014ZWHZQ,"Cant live withiut this product.I swear by this product!! Seriously, if i stop using, within 3 days my eyes look so bad and i look older!!! Its my number one secret (along with Oil of Olay regenerest)I have very sensitive eyes, anything near and my eyes water, turn red, burn. But not with this. Its one of the only products i can use, but im glad because it WORKS. You have to follow the way the directions show, ( upward outward application) for best results) and i do it immediately after washing my face. Or at least i splash cold water overvmy eyecarea, pat dry, then apply to lockbin moisture.Its a great product which, sadly is now hard to find. I only can find it a Kmart and their prices are high.Here on Amazon, this supplier has the best prices with the fastest shipping.HIGHLY RECCOMEND!","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2019","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZ6ODFQHG6IBOJFBCKFNCESL32Q,J,0,5.0 out of 5 stars,,A MUST for Me!

B0014ZWHZQ,I have been using this brand for years! The red cream goes on upper lids and gives you an instant lift and the white cream goes underneath eyes- moisturizes and minimizes lines! I love!!

B0014ZWHZQ,This gave me a stye on my eye unfortunately. I was so excited to start using eye cream and less than a week later I developed a stye. I guess I was better off using nothing. I've never had a stye in my life at 40 years old until now. So unfortunately I won't be able to use this anymore.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/4ee963ed-0406-47d5-8332-729bab649640._CR0,26.0,281,281_SX48_.jpg",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGI3GFVCZI7ZY3AFE34WY5AKOQ5A,amy,2,1.0 out of 5 stars,,Gave me a stye,Verified Purchase,"7 people found this helpful

B0014ZWHZQ,I like the creaminess of the eye moisturizer & mixing the two products in my hand but don't like that they each dispense with a different button. It's difficult to press each button the same to dispense them equally. I also purchased the same product for whole face and it is dispensed with one button controlling both products. Really wish they did this with the eye cream too.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2019","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AECEXJPIQ4L4VTQQ4BHVCB2EFJGA,ariesmom,0,3.0 out of 5 stars,,Good product but don't like the two button dispenser.,Verified Purchase,"7 people found this helpful

B0014ZWHZQ,"I'm almost 40. Actually closer to 40 than 38. Yet I still get carded for cigarettes and alcohol and I swear it has a lot to do with RevitaLift products. I use them religiously and my skin looks young with no wrinkles at all. Even works better than the $100 skin caviar I've purchased in the past. If you want an affordable way to look your youngest, this is it.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2015","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/b028706b-ea7c-4b43-a6f1-f07254d60ac7._CR0,0,428,428_SX48_.jpg",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFG4MNZNFG2REZKQBJFABMLW4VCA,Phoenix,0,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Keeping Me Wrinkle Free,Verified Purchase,"25 people found this helpful

B0014ZWHZQ,"Let me start by saying that L'Oreal is my go-to brand for skin care and make-up--especially when I want to try something new. I know that I can trust this brand to not hurt by skin by causing a rash, etc. So when I began getting these hard white bumps on my eyelids --both upper and lower--I did not think it was skin care related at first. I thought maybe they were a part of the aging process. After doing some research I did find out that the ingredient parrafinum liquidum that is listed in this product can cause these little white bumps. I had been using this product religiously for about the last 6 weeks. I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin or if your pores clog easily with product. But I will happily recommend other products by L'Oreal.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2020","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/0aac37d0-c978-4d1e-8cf1-df31390781b0._CR1,0,98,98_UX110_.png",/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLKEDYD552NWJDILZ4ZDHTOWQFQ,Courtney,0,2.0 out of 5 stars,,"Love L'Oreal - this product, not so much...",Verified Purchase,"One person found this helpful
