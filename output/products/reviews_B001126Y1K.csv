I am an NC42/44 girl, and it's so hard to find makeup that goes on that yellow. I've tried most foundations, basically, MAC(NC42/44), Estee Lauder (Toasted Toffee), MakeupForever (153),Kat Von D, Benefit, Maybelline (honey beige), Covergirl(tawny), Almay, Revlon(caramel)...and the list continues. Its embarrassing how many products I have bought.Anyway, I am a Caramel Beige in this makeup. It isn't yellow enough for me, but the coverage is excellent. It lasts pretty long with primer, but without primer, after 8 hours its gone. Even though there is a slight golden sparkle to it, it isnt that noticeable. It is the best and closest match for over the counter foundations I have found so far. The True Match Lumi is better but it doesnt carry darker than Sun Beige in warm. I usually use this foundation this to conceal and use  a better foundation over for a skin tone match.","5 people found this helpful

First I tried it as a coverage foundation but it was too sheer and it didnt cover anything or fix and natural color blemishes of my face. (I'd like to mention that I did choose a shade way too light).I cleamed that off and used the last bit of my almay foundation and used this to highlight. That worked out pretty well and even though I didnt love it, I could definitely work with it.What ruined the look was when I used the loreal trumatch powder and it made my whole face cakey and really defined my pores.I asked my husband how the make up looked and his exact words were ""It looks like you got old...QUICK""I dont recommend this product and I am disappointed.I'll give 2 stars for the packaging and the highlighting effect.",Helpful,0,B001126Y1K

First, it's actually yellow enough for me, which is an amazing feat of itself. I tried 3 different shades, and found the one perfect for my summer/spring color. I used a little white foundation mixer to lighten for my winter color since the next lightest shade was wayyy too light. Wish there was a W3.5 because it would be perfect for me for winter. Anyway, the texture of this makeup is so velvety and luxurious! It is definitely a liquid-to-powder finish, not glowy like the Lumi foundation Loreal makes. The LUMI foundation makes me look sweaty within an hour or so because I have oily skin. I love how the original True Match Super Blendable Foundation melts into your skin and finishes to a soft semi-matte, very natural look. Easy to work on with a brush or with your fingers. It lasts a full 8 hours on me with no blotting, no primer, only finishing with a matte powder(Rimmel Stay matte powder). It would probably last longer if I used a primer. I have VERY oily skin, so the fact it stayed on my face so well means something. I'd definitely give it a try, especially for the price. I purchased for under $6 on here, locally it retails for around $9.",Helpful,0,B001126Y1K

I do, however, like to keep makeup on hand for special occasions, so I chose this foundation.I used a dry foundation brush and it went on incredibly smooth and blended very well.  The shade is a near perfect match for my olive skin tone.  It feels very light and does not crease.  It also did not leave my skin feeling greasy - it felt like there was nothing there at all.  Since I only played around it with it one evening, I cannot attest to how how long it lasts or how often it needs applied.  My skin type is mixed and tends to be sensitive.  This product applied well to all areas and did not cause any irritation or reaction.","3 people found this helpful

I have combination skin, so my only problem is that I always need to re-powder my T-zone every now and then (I use the Maybelline FITme translucent powder and/or some Clean&Clear blotting sheets), but for the price, you really can't beat this foundation. The color came out to be darker than I expected, but maybe it's because I can't really get try on this product like I can at Sephora and such.I would highly recommend getting two colors, one darker than your skin tone and one lighter than your skin color, and blending them to fit your complexion since I know mine varies season to season. You can also use them to contour your face this way.","4 people found this helpful

Sick and tired of buying foundation after foundation that was too pink, too orange, or ""oxidized"" on my face. (Like, really MAC? 30 bucks a compact and it turns orange halfway through the day?) I have a very strong golden undertone to my skin,and I saw that this line of makeup was made for three different types of skin tones, one, for yellow undertones. Normally I wouldn't look twice at a liquid foundation, as I have skin that tends to let slip a fine oil-slick on my cheeks, nose and forehead, and liquid is a no-no for oily complexions, but I was so desperate to have an even color transition from neck to face I bought it anyways.The Good:Fantastic coverage; those models are not smiling through a very thick layer of photo shop.Great for blending: I always wondered what the jess that meant, and now I know: this makeup can make a seamless transition from jaw to neck without that dreaded ""makeup line"". It also makes a great base for bronzer and blush; it is very easy to build up other colors.Light: Foundation is very weightless and its easy to forget its there.Holy crap, it lasts: All day cover, none of that trying-to-reapply-in-the-middle-of-the-day junk. You put it on in the morning. You take it off at night. That was something I never was able to do with anything else.The Bad, which really isn't so bad:It is a liquid makeup, which means for me, I need a little extra. I fluff on a thin layer of translucent loose power to contradict any nasty shine that might sneak up on me during the day. Other than that, I don't need like a matching powder or anything. Looks good. <3","16 people found this helpful

This isn't full coverage, but you can build it up. I'd say it's about a medium coverage foundation. I'm a huge fan of the fact they they added warm, cool, and neutral tones. I choose the cool toned Alabaster to counteract that redness that I tend to get and it works great! It lasts well throughout the day, too. The only complaint I have, and it's minor, is that if you have any dry patches they will definitely show with this foundation. I tend to get dryness around my nose and mouth, and can sometimes have an issue with it picking up that dryness. Moisturizing before bed and before application usually resolves/helps with that issue. I also have sensitive skin and this has never made me break out. So, all in all, this is my go to foundation. Especially since it's affordable.",Helpful,0,B001126Y1K

I bought this foundation after watching a celebrity makeup artist's review recommending this foundation on YouTube and other positive on-line reviws.  I think this is one of the best drugstore brand foundation you can buy.  It is a beautiful formula, it has no fragrance, filler or oil.  It has a light to medium coverage but buildable if you need more coverage.  It has a dewy, satiny finish without looking oily or dry pasty finish.  Received many compliments on my skin after wearing this foundation.  I don't have a good skin, it's due to this foundation.  The shade choices are phenomenal. I finally found my perfect foundation in shade (W4 Natural Beige) to match my skin tone and will stay with this product forever, hope they don't discountinue it.",Helpful,0,B001126Y1K

I'm a graphic designer and am fascinated by color theory, so when I saw all the color options and warm/cool/neutral categories, it caught my eye. I'm so glad I made the purchase! I was truly able to get a perfect match (it helps to know your ""season"" to know which category to go with). AND it costs so much less than all the products I'd been trying out previously (including Cover Girl, Neutrogena, and Maybelline). I think it provides the perfect amount of coverage. It's not too thick, where people can tell you're wearing makeup, but not too thin either, where everything shows through. It gives a wonderful, natural look. I'm acne prone, so on bad days I'll still need to use a little cover-up in addition to this foundation. It has not made my acne any worse. I think what I like about it most is it's ""powdery"" feel when I rub it in. It's so smooth, and even soft. I don't know how a liquid can be soft, but it somehow is!

I could have saved myself so much time and money if I would have just tried it out earlier! I could kick myself! After using Revlon Colorstay 110 Ivory for years, I am surprised that L'Oreal's True Match is the perfect foundation for me. The foundation I've been using before was way too pink for my skin but I ignored it, hoping no one would notice. After getting more into makeup, I realized that even the palest person in the world needs a foundation specifically meant for them. True Match has dozens of shades that are sure to suit anyone's skin color, whether it be cool, warm, or neutral. The coverage isn't full, which I would prefer, but it is build-able using a sponge or brush. It is a thinner liquid so it is perfect for blending.The smell is somewhat like a vanilla extract, though others compare it to a paint smell. I personally like it. The only thing I would suggest is to try it out in a store first. I am a cool and the Alabaster was too pink for me, so I got the warm Porcelain. It matches my neck and chest to a T so it looks like I'm not wearing any makeup at all. I wish all makeups were made specifically for undertones and not just the color of skin. This makeup will add a glow and make you look healthy. It is not shiny or a matte finish. It's amazing. Will definitely repurchase!",Helpful,0,B001126Y1K
